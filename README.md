## Value Proposition in Python Ecosystems
a paragraph describing where your packages fit into the Python and R ecosystems (are there any other Python or R software packages that have the same/similar functionality? Provide links to any that do. if none exist, then clearly state this as well)

Memes are so commonly shared that, according to Google Trends, "memes" are becoming a more popular search term than "Jesus."
Memes are widely used in social media platform. This is the new way millennials communicate and express themselves with each other. 
So far we haven't found any similar python packages that combine meme generation, color filtering and image crop in one package.
